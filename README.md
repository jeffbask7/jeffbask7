### Hi there 👋

Hey! I'm Jeff Baskin 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile :) I'm Jeff, a meteorologist and data analyst working on weather visualization applications

🔭 I’m currently working on integrating grid model data for renewable energy forecast generation and forecast energy demand
🌱 I’m currently learning database management in aws

🎈 In my free time, I like to get some cool drone video.

This is where I keep my code and projects. Feel free to look around and contact me if you have questions.

👨‍💻 Data Projects I've Made:
Deep analysis of past Atlantic Hurricane seasons based on NHC HURDAT data
In this project, I visualize the activity of past hurricane seasons, including number of landfalls per storm and the strength at each landfall.

Forecasting energy demand by U.S. County based on forecast temperature
Visualizing energy demand by County using a gridded model forecast (GFS in this example) to calculate number of heating degree days for the next day based on average of forecast heating degree hours. Optionally adjusted for population. Can be filtered by RTO footprints.
